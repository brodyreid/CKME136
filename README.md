# Airport Activity as a Predictor of Regional Economic Development

Included are all the `R-markdown` files that were exported as Word documents.

### Goal
I developed a model to predict a city’s economic growth given its airport’s activity.

### Data
All of the airport-level datasets were sourced from the Government of Canada’s Open Data Portal and were structured. The economic-level datasets were sourced from a third-party and were unstructured.

### Method
1. Clean the structured and unstructured datasets using `R`.
2. Select attributes in `Weka`.
3. Apply multiple linear regressions in `R`.
4. Visualize the results in `R` and `Excel`.

### Results
It was determined that in major Canadian cities, with all else equal, a 10% increase in passenger activity produces a 1%-4% increase in individual median income and a 0.5%-1% increase in employment.
